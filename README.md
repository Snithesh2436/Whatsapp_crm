# Message Generator (WhatsApp CRM Feature)

This project adds a **Message Generator** feature to the WhatsApp CRM tool.  
Users can enter a simple prompt (e.g., "Diwali wishes"), and the system generates a predefined message template with placeholders like **{name}** for personalization. The generated message can then be tweaked and sent through the broadcast flow.

## Features
- Generate predefined messages from user prompts  
- Clean and responsive **Tailwind CSS UI**  
- Edit messages before sending  
- Easy integration into existing WhatsApp CRM  

## Setup
```bash
